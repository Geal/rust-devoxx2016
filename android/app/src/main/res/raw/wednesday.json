I will introduce unikernels for newcomers, and then describe two ways we are integrating them with Docker.\r\n\r\nFirst, I will show Docker for Mac & Windows, which both utilise unikernel technology under-the-hood to make running Docker on Mac OS X and Windows hosts as transparent as possible. This will include build conventional and unconventional scenarios from Compose-based web stacks, to unikernel compilation, to cross-compiling ARM containers on a normal Mac or Windows host.\r\n\r\nSecond, I will show how we have been integrating unikernels with existing deployments, using MirageOS unikernels to augment an existing LAMP stack deployment, managed uniformly using the popular Docker toolchain (Docker build, Docker run, and the Docker Hub).\r\n\r\nUnikernels can thus be used to augment and evolve existing polyglot VM and container deployments, one microservice at a time. We no longer need a revolution: welcome to the evolution!\r\n"},"fromTime":"17:50","toTimeMillis":1478713800000,"toTime":"18:50","roomCapacity":347,"roomName":"Room 4","slotId":"conf_room4_wednesday_9_17h50_18h50","day":"wednesday"},{"roomId":"room3","notAllocated":false,"fromTimeMillis":1478710200000,"break":null,"roomSetup":"theatre","talk":{"trackId":"ssj","talkType":"Conference","track":"Server Side Java","summaryAsHtml":"<p>‚ÄúIt is not necessary to change.
