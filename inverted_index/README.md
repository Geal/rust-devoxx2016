# Example Android app with a Rust library

This application builds an inverted index of the Devoxx 2016 talks for an easy offline search.
It is implemented both in Java and Rust.

The slides are available at http://dev.unhandledexpression.com/slides/devoxx-2016/

Another example of sharing Rust code between an iOS and Android app,
using JNI to talk to Rust, is available at https://github.com/Geal/rust_on_mobile
